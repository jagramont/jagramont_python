Hej
This is my Git for my python course 2023 

# Course project in progress:

The script: is the file named ppk_biofilm-quant.ipynb (jupyter notebook)
The script is designed to read a .csv file that contains Absorvance values. The values are measurements of biofilm production in a system of 96 well plates.
Biofilm production was quantified along five days.
Each culture treatment (all possible combinations of each member of PPK: 8 possible combinations) has at least 8 technical replicates.
The script can read the data of the csv file and make a line plot to explore the biofilm production of each culture treatment along five days.
The script can analyze the biofilm production at any timepoint of the assay, for example day 1. The analysis consist on checking the distribution of the data, determine the most 
adecuated statistical tool to use: one-way anova for normally distributed data and Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed data.
After using one of the previus tests, the script can perform a pos hoc analysis: Tukey test if the data was analysed using one-way anova or Dunn test if the data was analyzed by 
Kruskal-Wallis test.
The script will generate a box plot showing the mean and SD for each treatment on a given timepoint (day). 
#The PPK community
Has three members:
Pao1
KP1
PF5  
#test data
A csv file is included in the repository: ppk_biofilm.csv
